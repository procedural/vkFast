# TinyBVH
Single-header BVH construction and traversal library written as "Sane C++" (or "C with classes"). Some C++11 is used, e.g. for threading. The library has no dependencies. 

# TinyOCL
Single-header OpenCL library, which helps you select and initialize a device. It also loads, compiles and runs kernels, with several convenient features:
* Include-file expansion for AMD devices
* Multi-argument passing
* Host/device buffer management
* Vendor and architecture detection and propagation to #defines in OpenCL code
* ..And many other things.

To use tinyocl, just include ````tiny_ocl.h````; this will automatically cause linking with ````OpenCL.lib```` in the 'external' folder, which in turn passes on work to vendor-specific driver code. But all that is not your problem!

Note that the ````tiny_bvh.h```` library will work without ````tiny_ocl.h```` and remains dependency-free. The new ````tiny_ocl.h```` is only needed in projects that wish to trace rays _on the GPU_ using BVHs created by ````tiny_bvh.h````. 
  
# BVH?
A Bounding Volume Hierarchy is a data structure used to quickly find intersections in a virtual scene; most commonly between a ray and a group of triangles. You can read more about this in a series of articles on the subject: https://jacco.ompf2.com/2022/04/13/how-to-build-a-bvh-part-1-basics .

Right now TinyBVH comes with the following builders:
* ````BVH::Build```` : Efficient plain-C/C+ binned SAH BVH builder which should run on any platform.
* ````BVH::BuildAVX```` : A highly optimized version of BVH::Build for Intel CPUs.
* ````BVH::BuildHQ```` : A 'spatial splits' BVH builder, for highest BVH quality.

A constructed BVH can be used to quickly intersect a ray with the geometry, using ````BVH::Intersect```` or ````BVH::IsOccluded````, for shadow rays. The double-precision BVH is traversed using ````BVH::IntersectEx````.

Apart from the default BVH layout (simply named ````BVH````), several other layouts are available, which all serve one or more specific purposes. You can create a BVH in the desired layout by instantiating the appropriate class, or by converting from ````BVH```` using the ````::ConvertFrom```` methods. The available layouts are:
* ````BVH```` : A compact format that stores the AABB for a node, along with child pointers and leaf information in a cross-platform-friendly way. The 32-byte size allows for cache-line alignment.
* ````BVH_SoA```` : This format stores bounding box information in a SIMD-friendly format, making the BVH faster to traverse.
* ````BVH_Double```` : Double-precision version of ````BVH````.
* ````BVH_GPU```` : This format uses 64 bytes per node and stores the AABBs of the two child nodes. This is the format presented in the [2009 Aila & Laine paper](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2009-08_Understanding-the-Efficiency/aila2009hpg_paper.pdf). It can be traversed with a simple GPU kernel.
* ````MBVH<M>```` : In this (templated) format, each node stores M child pointers, reducing the depth of the tree. This improves performance for divergent rays. Based on the [2008 paper](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~boulos/papers/multi_rt08.pdf) by Ingo Wald et al.
* ````BVH4_GPU```` : A compact version of the ````BVH4```` format, which will be faster for GPU ray tracing.
* ````BVH4_CPU```` : SSE-optimzied wide BVH traversal. The fastest option for CPUs that do not support AVX.
* ````BVH8_CPU```` : AVX2-optimized wide BVH traversal. This is the fastest option on CPU.
* ````BVH8_CWBVH```` : An advanced 80-byte representation of the 8-wide BVH, for state-of-the-art GPU rendering, based on the [2017 paper](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-07_efficient-incoherent-ray-traversal-gpus-through-compressed-wide-bvhs) by Ylitie et al. and [code by AlanWBFT](https://github.com/AlanIWBFT/CWBVH).

A BVH in any format can be _rebuilt_ at any time by calling the ````Build```` method on the changed triangle data. A BVH may also be _refitted_, in case the triangles moved, using ````BVH::Refit````. Refitting is substantially faster than rebuilding and works well if the animation is subtle. Refitting does not work if polygon counts change.

Most layouts may be serialized and de-serialized via ````::Save```` and ````::Load````.

A more complete overview of TinyBVH functionality can be found in the [Basic Use Manual](https://jacco.ompf2.com/2025/01/24/tinybvh-manual-basic-use) and the [Advanced Topics Manual](https://jacco.ompf2.com/2025/01/25/tinybvh-manual-advanced).

# How To Use
The library ````tiny_bvh.h```` is designed to be easy to use. Please have a look at tiny_bvh_minimal.cpp for an example. A Visual Studio 'solution' (.sln/.vcxproj) is included, as well as a CMake file. That being said: The examples consists of only a single source file, which can be compiled with clang or g++, e.g.:

````g++ tiny_bvh_minimal.cpp````

The cross-platform fenster-based single-source **bitmap renderer** can be compiled with

````g++ -mwindows -O3 tiny_bvh_fenster.cpp -o tiny_bvh_fenster```` (on windows)

````c++ --std=c++11 -framework Cocoa -O3 tiny_bvh_fenster.cpp -o tiny_bvh_fenster```` (on macOS)

The multi-threaded **path tracing** demo can be compiled with

````g++ -mwindows -O3 tiny_bvh_pt.cpp -o tiny_bvh_pt```` (on windows)

````c++ --std=c++11 -framework Cocoa -O3 tiny_bvh_pt.cpp -o tiny_bvh_pt```` (on macOS)

The **performance measurement tool** can be compiled with:

````g++ -mavx2 -mfma -Ofast tiny_bvh_speedtest.cpp -o tiny_bvh_speedtest```` (on windows)

````c++ --std=c++11 -framework OpenCL -Ofast tiny_bvh_speedtest.cpp -o tiny_bvh_speedtest```` (on macOS)

Many additional demos are provided, demonstrating features of the library in small source files.

# Version 1.6.7

Basic use:

````
BVH bvh;
bvh.Build( (bvhvec4*)myTriData, triangleCount ); // or: BuildHQ( .. )
bvh.Intersect( ray );
````

To build a BVH for indexed vertices, use the new indexed interface:

````
BVH bvh;
bvh.Build( (bvhvec4*)vertices, (uint32_t*)indices, triangleCount );
````

If you wish to use a specific builder (such as the spatial splits builder) or if you need to do custom operations on the BVH, such as post-build optimizing, you can still do the conversions manually. Example:

````
BVH bvh;
bvh.BuildHQ( verts, indices, triCount );
BVH_Verbose tmp;
tmp.ConvertFrom( bvh );
tmp.Optimize( 100 );
bvh.ConvertFrom( tmp );
printf( "Optimized BVH SAH cost: %f\n", bvh.SAHCost() );
````

Note that in this case, data ownership and lifetime must be managed carefully. Specifically, layouts converted from other layouts use data from the original, so both must be kept alive.

# Platforms
TinyBVH is a cross-platfrom library and should build on any platform that supports C++20 (the '20' bit is for threading). That being said, several platforms are specifically supported:
* ````x86/x64 Windows/Linux````: These platforms benefit from highly optimized SSE/AVX/AVX2 traversal kernels.
* ````OPENCL````: Although TinyBVH does not directly use OpenCL, GPU-specific BVHs can be constructed and example code for BLAS/TLAS traversal in OpenCL is provided.
* ````OpenGL/compute````: Example compute shader code for BLAS traversal is also provided.
* ````ARM_NEON````: Efficient BVH construction code is provided for ARM NEON. The ````BVH_SoA```` layout uses NEON intrinsics for fast traversal.
* ````ANDROID````: This platform benefits from ARM NEON support as well as aligned memory allocation.
* ````APPLE````: This platform benefits from ARM NEON support, dedicated paths in GPU example code and specialized support in TinyBVH itself.
